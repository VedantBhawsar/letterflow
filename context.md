# Letterflow Landing Directory Context

This document provides a high-level overview of the `letterflow-landing` directory structure and its impact on the website's functionality.

## Directory Structure

- **`.next`:** This directory is automatically generated by Next.js and contains the compiled and optimized code for the application. It is not meant to be directly modified.
- **`prisma`:** This directory contains the Prisma schema (`schema.prisma`) which defines the database structure and relations.
- **`public`:** This directory contains static assets such as images, fonts, and other files that are served directly to the browser.
- **`src`:** This directory contains the source code for the Next.js application.
  - **`app`:** This directory contains the route handlers, page components, and layout components for the application. It defines the different pages and API endpoints of the website.
  - **`components`:** This directory contains reusable UI components used throughout the application.
  - **`lib`:** This directory contains utility functions, helper modules, and context providers used by the application.

## Impact on Website Functionality

The `letterflow-landing` directory is the root directory for the Letterflow landing page website. The structure of this directory directly impacts the website's functionality by organizing the code, assets, and configuration files in a logical and maintainable way.

- The `app` directory defines the different pages and API endpoints of the website, allowing users to access different content and interact with the application.
- The `components` directory provides reusable UI elements that are used to build the website's user interface.
